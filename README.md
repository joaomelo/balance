# TL;DR
_What problem it solves?_

Balance is a minimal solution for finance self-management. It can record accounts balances (from credit cards or loans for example) and show their evolution in a chart.

It is an unsophisticated software which tries to settle the need for minimal personal finance management for someone ~~too lazy~~ unable to do the correct tracking based on individual transactions, category analysis and accounts reconciliation. 

# Motivation
_Why it was built?_

The problem can surely be solved with some spreadsheet shenanigans. Though, why lose some hours learning how to implement an algorithm in Excel if you can burn dozens more coding your own software?

Seriously, I built the project mainly to explore in practice some techs and architectural approaches in a front-end web app. Mostly:
- feasibility of single page applications without a traditional backend using serverless services;
- some concepts from [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure-ebook-dp-B075LRM681/dp/B075LRM681/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) and [Grokking Simplicity](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-simplicity?gclid=CjwKCAjw3MSHBhB3EiwAxcaEu7fdoYDomaXaYdL8obQ_-fKzSvr_gqgYZzf_s53g9lpfPHfTnG1sARoCFLYQAvD_BwE);
- UI craft with React functional components and hooks;
- reactive state management without a central store like Redux or Vuex;
- end-to-end testing with Microsoft Playwright.

# Usage
_What are the features?_

The main output is a time series chart to assess the net balance evolution from accounts and groups. We can see a naive example below. 

![Chart example](docs/chart-example.jpg)

But the first step is to feed the relevant data.

## Accounts

Accounts can be used to represent things like savings, credit cards, loans, long term investments and assets as houses or cars. Bellow an example on how to create an account in the app.

![Add accounts](docs/add-accounts.gif)

## Balances

A balance states the net value for one account at a given day. Here we create some balance records:

![Add balances](docs/add-balances.gif)

## Groups

Accounts can be optionally grouped. Every group will appear as an additional time series in the history chart with calculated balances based on the accounts they aggregate.

![Add group](docs/add-groups.gif)

## History Chart

The history chart shows the balance progression for every account and group. The chart is interactive and series can be hidden to facilitate analysis.

Groups balances are the sum of its accounts balances. The calculation will deal with mismatch dates using the most recent past balance at a given date.

The follow example show the history chart for two groups with two accounts each.

# Runtime
_How production works?_

Balance is a traditional single page application. The production artifacts are one HTML and some JavaScript files. I use [Firebase hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) to serve them, but any other web server will do just fine.

To arrive at that production code, Balance takes advantage of the JavaScript thriving open source ecosystem. [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) are the UI backbone. [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) supports the state management. [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) enable unit and e2e testing. The [package.json](package.json) file lists the many others libraries I was fortune to have access.

The web app relies on two serverless services provided by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to save data related to accounts, groups, and balances and [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) supports user authentication.

The next sections will cover how to run your own instance of Balance locally and in production, but you will need to [create and set up](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) a Firebase project for that.

# Wrapping up
_What to expect?_

The project has very limited ambitions. Although some bugs will undoubtedly come, there are not many more things to do as long as I can see. If you need any help, I'm glad to listen. Just contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joaomeloplus).

üññ Live long and prosper.

# Development
_describe the runtime architecture?_
_what are the production artifacts?_
_what is the main tech stack behind the scenes?_
_How to run it locally?_
_How to develop it?_

The first step is to clone the repo with git and install all dependencies.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/joaomelo/lib.git
npm i
```

Now you can get familiar with the project directories and files.

``` js
üìÇattache
  *.*         // project files
  üìÅ.github   // github actions for ci/cd pipeline
  üìÅdist      // bundled code for production
  üìÅsrc       
    üìÅapp     // services and i/o
    üìÅdomain  // business core
    üìÅhelpers // generic functions
    üìÅmain    // glues everything into serverless functions
  üìÅtests     // support test files
```

Before we start developing, we need to get rid of some environmental tasks.

## Environment Configuration

To enable Firebase [Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) and [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), you need to create a [Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup) and set local development with their [local emulator suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite).

Now is also an excellent time to create accounts and note the search and email services' API keys. [Scale SERP](https://www.scaleserp.com/) and [Send Grid](https://sendgrid.com/) sites have the proper instructions.

Regarding Send Grid, It is essential to register the email you will use to dispatch Track Reports.

With all that information in hand, we can create a `.env` file at the project root directory and fill it with our services' corresponding data.

``` env
FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8080
SCALE_SERP_KEY=SOME_API_KEY_VALUE
SEND_GRID_KEY=SOME_API_KEY_VALUE
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=some@email.com
```

I must say I have no affiliation with any of these services. I chose them from personal familiarity, ease of use, or free tier convenience. But Attach√© was built aiming at easy substitutions. You can take advantage of that if some of the services do not suit your particular needs.

## Engine Start

The project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. By executing `npm start`, you turn on tests in watch mode and can begin coding. It is easy to focus on a particular module applying file patterns through Jest CLI options.

But be aware these tests don't massage the final serverless functions. These functions are tiny and take care only of putting together dependencies. Nevertheless, If you want to run them locally, type the command `npm run shell`.

The [shell interface](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/local-shell) enables local interactive invoke of Firebase functions from the command line.

# Deploy
_How to deploy to production from my machine?_
_How to use Guthub actions?_

## Locally

You can deploy the serverless functions to Firebase from your local machine. To do that, execute `npm run deploy:local`.

This command will take advantage of the same `.env` file used for development and the Firebase project configuration.

## Continuous Delivery

There is also a workflow to deploy automatically from GitHub using GitHub Actions.

This pipeline additionally uploads test reports to [Codecov]( https://about.codecov.io) service. Codecov generates complete and interactive code coverage reports. You can create a free account and obtain an API key on their website.

Going back to GitHub Actions, you need to set some GitHub variables for things to work correctly. You do that by creating a GitHub secret for every workflow variable. The secrets required are listed below.

```
FIREBASE_PROJECT 
FIREBASE_TOKEN
SCALE_SERP_KEY
SEND_GRID_KEY
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
CODECOV_TOKEN
```
